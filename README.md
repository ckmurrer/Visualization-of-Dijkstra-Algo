# Visualization-of-Dijkstra-Algo

This program will implement a visualization of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm using Python3 and the Pygame module for the graphical interface.

05/09/2021 - Day One of Developing

This is my first time seriously using the Python language so the syntax is new to me but easy to understand. I had to research the Pygame module for the documentation on how to handle creating and populating a window. I had implemented the window screen that will be used for the visualization of the algorithm and populated it with a 31x31 grid using a 2D array on the screen. This will be used in the future to allow the placements of nodes and barriers blocking the path of the algorithm to show how it is able to move around objects until it meets its desired node endpoint.
